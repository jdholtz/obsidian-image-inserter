# Obsidian Simple Image Inserter
This [Obsidian][0] plugin allows you to insert images without needing an external File Explorer GUI.
The images are selected through a built-in file explorer, automatically embedded into your notes,
and copied to your Obsidian vault.

This plugin was inspired by [Better File Link][1].
